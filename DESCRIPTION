Title: Toolkit for Compiling, (Post-Hoc) Testing, and Plotting Regression Results
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Compiling regression results into a publishable format, 
    conducting post-hoc hypothesis testing, and plotting moderating effects. Saving headaches for
    "theory-driven" researchers in social science who value the interpretability of independent variables (X),  
    theorize on the mechanisms (why X affects Y), and look for the boundary conditions (moderating effect) 
    of the main effect (the effect of X on Y becomes stronger/weaker as Z increases).
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
